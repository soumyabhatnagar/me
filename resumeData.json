You‚Äôve always said to maintain stuff, efforts from both the ends matter.\nSince you‚Äôve always been on my side\nI never realised how important you are to me,\nUntil I was about to lose you.\nSince that day there has been no day that I didn‚Äôt put my step ahead and live up to what we‚Äôre entitled too - BFF\nObviously can‚Äôt imagine to lose a gem like you. Even though I‚Äôm uncertain about some things in life but I‚Äôm certain that I love you and will genuinely continue to love you forever.\nIt‚Äôs already been 20 years and I know it would continue till the last breath\nCan‚Äôt blame myself for such a dramatic speech\nAfter all it was for you lol.",
