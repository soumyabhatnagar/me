My name is Somu.” said a girl in white frock 20 years ago to a girl who had no idea about the lifetime package that came with her.\nThe story has a lot of chapters but little did we know that we would become\nFrom strangers to best friends forever\nFrom talking about what to play today to what to chose in life to never ending list.\nIt’s amazing to see such a pretty girl turn into a beautiful woman.\nAnd being with you in that process is such a blessing. You’ve always said to maintain stuff, efforts from both the ends matter.\nSince you’ve always been on my side\nI never realised how important you are to me,\nUntil I was about to lose you.\nSince that day there has been no day that I didn’t put my step ahead and live up to what we’re entitled too - BFF\nObviously can’t imagine to lose a gem like you. Even though I’m uncertain about some things in life but I’m certain that I love you and will genuinely continue to love you forever.\nIt’s already been 20 years and I know it would continue till the last breath\nCan’t blame myself for such a dramatic speech\nAfter all it was for you lol.",
